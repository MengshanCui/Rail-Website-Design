He is also the Director of the Rutgers Rail and Transit Program (RTP), leading and managing a portfolio of rail-centric research, education, and workforce development initiatives. Dr. Liu's research focuses on artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and automation technologies for improving rail operational safety and efficiency. Dr. Liu has published over 100 papers in peer-reviewed journals and international conferences. Dr. Liu’s rail & transit research has been supported by a variety of public and private sectors in the United States. Dr. Liu is the Associate Editor for the Journal of Rail Transport Planning & Management, and Journal of Smart and Resilient Transportation. Dr. Liu has received four “Best Paper” awards from the Transportation Research Board (TRB), the “Educator of the Year 2017” Award, and the “Researcher of the Year 2018”, both in New Jersey. In 2018, he received a “Rising Star” award from the Progressive Railroading magazine. Dr. Liu currently teaches several railroad courses at Rutgers. He is a Faculty Advisor to Rutgers AREMA Student Chapter. In 2019, he received the Young Alumnus Achievement Award from the Civil and Environmental Engineering Alumni Association at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His students are employed across academia and industry, with placements at institutions such as Universtiy of Huston, Shanghai Jiaotong University, and companies such as Google, Meta, and Amazon."
